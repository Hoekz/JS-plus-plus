JS-plus-plus
============

My first real attempt at a Javascript Library.  Inspired by AngularJS, provides an easy way to make a more dynamic web page.  Also provides an easy way to create classes with a similar syntax to that of C++.  It does use the eval statement which I know to be rather taboo among developers, but feel it's used in a secure and helpful way.  Always want feedback and always want to improve.
